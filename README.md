this is a repo for the LEARNING OPENGL course on linked in.

i will try to keep it up to date and functional, but please keep in mind course material is from 2014, and that can be tricky to do.

see the FAQ.txt for some troubleshooting tips.

you can also run example files from command line (currently tested on mac:)-- e.g.:
```./run.sh examples/Cube.cpp```
